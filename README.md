## Introduction & Our Philosophy

[![stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/featbit/featbit.svg?style=flat&logo=github&colorB=red&label=stars)](https://github.com/featbit/featbit)                   [![slack-community](https://img.shields.io/badge/slack-join-3CC798?style=social&logo=slack)](https://join.slack.com/t/featbit/shared_invite/zt-1ew5e2vbb-x6Apan1xZOaYMnFzqZkGNQ)  [![License](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=license&message=MIT&color=brightgreen)](https://github.com/featbit/featbit/blob/main/LICENSE)

**FeatBit** is a scalable, high-performance **Feature Management** and **Progressive Experimentation** platform.

Feature Management, which progressively delegating the control of a feature to the owner that is most closely responsible for the outcome. Common use cases: `Trunk-based development`, `Testing in production`, `Progressive & Targeted release`, `Kill switches`, `Faster incident resolution`, `Data & Cloud Migration`, etc.
    
Progressive Experimentation, which provides the ability to get online and offline feedback as quickly as possible. Common use cases: `Beta testing and qualitative feedback`, `Experimentation and A/B testing`.

### Our Philosophy
**Empower All teams to Deliver, Control and Experiment with the software**. To enable continuous innovation in product development and to maintain a healthy iteration heartbeat.

### Philosophy

From `The art of community` - *Ideally, people would change/improve the products
("derivative designs") to address market needs that they perceive and we have not addressed.
That’s the sort of innovation that open source is designed to promote. But if they only clone the
products and sell them at lower prices, that’s okay, too. The marketplace will decide.*
