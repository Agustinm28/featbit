**FeatBit** is a scalable, high-performance **Feature Management** and **Progressive Experimentation** platform.

Feature Management use cases: `Trunk-based development`, `Testing in production`, `Progressive & Targeted release`, `Kill switches`, `Faster incident resolution`, `Data & Cloud Migration`, etc.
    
Progressive Experimentation, which provides the ability to get online and offline feedback as quickly as possible. Use cases: `Beta testing and qualitative feedback`, `Experimentation and A/B testing`.

### Our Philosophy
◆  **Empower All teams to Deliver, Control and Experiment with their software**. 

◆  Progressively delegating the control of a feature to the owner that is most closely responsible for the outcome.

◆  Less self-developed, more reusable open source software. 


## Getting Started

The project is under code refactoring. An update will be coming soon.
